This app is a preflight planning app in its infancy stage thus far. Here is the roadmap with the associated meaning behind the version numbers:

1.0.0 change in version number indicates a massively significant change. This can be:
  * language changes
  * added functionality
  * platform availability (In this particular instance endgame is use on iPad OS)
  * massively revamped user interactions

0.1.0 change in version number indicates a slightly significant change. This can be:
    * redesigned functions (for efficiency or updating away from outdated libraries)
    * user interface changes for better interactions

0.0.5 change in version number indicates:
    * a small or insignificant bug or number of bugs has been fixed 

This app is meant as a project. And open source at that. It is meant to demonstrate proficiency and currency in python and programming practices.

Current version 8/16/2023: V1.0.5
